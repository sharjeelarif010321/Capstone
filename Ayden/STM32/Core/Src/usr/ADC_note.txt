* DESCRIPTION:
* This file contains a note-to-self on how to edit the code. The IDE used (STM32CubeIDE) contains a lot of
* auto-generated code that re-generates every time modifications are made to the .ioc file. The note makes
* sure I remember to change the auto-generated code to prevent interference with my written code.

If changing ADC configuration via the .ioc file, make sure to add/modify the ADC_Select_CHxx functions in adc.c
	- IF ADDING NEW CHANNEL, MAKE SURE TO MAKE THE FUNCTION THE EXACT SAME AS THE OTHERS
		- CHANGE RANK TO 1, ADD SAMPLE TIME, ADD DECLARATION AT BEGINNING
	- MAKE SURE TO DELETE THE NEWLY-CREATED MX_ADC1_Init FUNCTION EVERY TIME
